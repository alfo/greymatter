          <blockquote>&ldquo;40 to 50 percent of the variability among us in antisocial behaviour is explained by genetics.&rdquo; <footer>&mdash; Adrian Raine</blockquote>

          <p><em>Grey Matter</em> has been developed from a scenario presented in psychologist Adrian Raine's recent book <em>The Anatomy of Violence</em>.  A long-term believer in the biological origins of crime, Raine describes different neurological indicators of a tendency towards anti-social behaviour before proposing the instigation of a national screening test for eighteen-year-olds and the detention of those who show a higher than 79% likelihood of committing violence. The basis of this play was to take the secure treatment facility exactly as described by Raine and explore through improvisation what would actually happen inside it.</p>

          <p>Into this world we have brought the condition of hemispatial neglect, inspired by the case study presented in <em>The Man who Mistook his Wife</em> for a Hat by renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks. The death of Sacks last year prompted the question of whether the exceptional humanity he shows in his writings would survive in a future where neurological research will increasingly affect our lives.</p>

          <p>Our presentation of psychopathy is closely based on the definitive account given in Robert D Hare's book <em>Without Conscience</em>. We also researched the backgrounds and experiences of inmates and officers in young offenders' institutions through direct contact as well as through publications such as <em>Young Offenders</em> by Mark Halsey and Simone Deegan, <em>Locked in - Locked Out</em> by Angela Neustatter and <em>Why Did You Do It?: Explanations for Offending by Young Offenders in their Own Words</em> by Jackie Worrall.</p>
